# favourites!
My essential **favourites** on web:
- [Feeds](#feeds)
- [Newsletters](#newsletters)
- [Browser extensions](browser-extensions.md)

> **Note**: I speak both Portuguese and English, so you *may* find some Portuguese-only content here.

## Feeds
![Feeds about Development, Engineering at Startups, Productivity](http://cl.ly/image/3D2K1r0m3y05/Image%202015-07-29%20at%203.12.12%20pm.png)
**[View list](feeds.opml)**.
> Available in OPML format (easy to import!). If you are just curious about my feeds, I suggest you to check the list through a OPML viewer, as seen that it's humanly impossible to read comfortably an extensive OPML file.

## Newsletters
Because I find it cool to open my inbox right in the morning and read some tech news.
> ###### TODO
> - [ ] Open source newsletters I'm subscribed to
> - [ ] Explain how I manage weeklies
