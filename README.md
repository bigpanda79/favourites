# favourites!
My essential **favourites** on web:
- [Feeds](#newsletters)
- [Bookmarks](#bookmarks)
- [Newsletters](#newsletters)
- [Podcasts](#podcasts)
- [Browser extensions](browser-extensions.md)

**As organised as possible**: [Feedly](http://feedly.com/), to read feeds; [Raindrop](http://raindrop.io), to manage bookmarks; [Player FM](https://player.fm), to listen and manage podcasts and  [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/a/favorites/list) to bookmark my favourite articles.

> **Note**: I'm still open sourcing my stuff, so this repo is going to be updated often. Also, I speak both Portuguese and English, so you *may* find some Portuguese-only content here.

## Feeds
![Feeds about Development, Engineering at Startups, Productivity](http://cl.ly/image/3D2K1r0m3y05/Image%202015-07-29%20at%203.12.12%20pm.png)
**[View list](feeds.opml)**.
> Available in OPML format (easy to import!). If you are just curious about my feeds, I suggest you to check the list through a OPML viewer, as seen that it's humanly impossible to read comfortably an extensive OPML file.

## Bookmarks
> ###### TODO
> - [ ] Share my coolest bookmarks
> - [ ] Explain how I organise them

## Newsletters
Because I find it cool to open my inbox right in the morning and read some tech news.
> ###### TODO
> - [ ] Open source newsletters I'm subscribed to
> - [ ] Explain how I manage weeklies

## Podcasts
I use [Player FM](https://player.fm) to manage and listen to podcasts.
> ###### TODO
> - [ ] Open source podcasts I listen to
> - [ ] Set my Player FM profile to public
